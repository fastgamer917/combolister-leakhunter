pip install celery
pip install redis
pip install flask

We need 3 tabs to run this combolister-leakhunter.
1. for celery
2. for redis
3. for flast that actually receive http reqests and forward to redis.

1=
To use celery along with multiprocessing, navigate to root folder and:
celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=info -P threads
in above command "app.celery" represents the file which defined "celery = make_celery(app)"
i.e point to where celery object is created.

2=
To run redis server:
redis-server
If any error in redis server, then `sudo service redis-server stop` and rerun above

3=
Running Flask app is bit different than running django.
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=7002
Make sure port is made open with aws or ufw.
